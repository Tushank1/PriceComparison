      <h2>Activities for sustainable social development</h2>
      <p>
        PriceCompare mission is to help consumers find better products and
        better prices. This means that we help consumers save money, but also to
        find better quality products that last longer.
      </p>
      <p>PriceCompare contributes to sustainable social development through:</p>
      <li>
        Helping millions of consumers compare prices for over 2.2 million
        products. This allows consumers to save billions. This contributes to
        price pressure and to reducing the concentration of profits in a small
        number of large companies. Instead, this surplus is distributed to
        millions of consumers, resulting in increased prosperity.
      </li>
      <li>
        We aim to have environmental filters on all product categories. In this
        way, we can help consumers reduce the climate impact of their purchases.
      </li>
      <li>
        We carry out professional long-term testing of products. This allows us
        to identify the most sustainable products. We prioritise serious
        companies and quality products, which reduces climate impact.
      </li>
      <li>
        We have a Code of Conduct that maintains a high standard regarding
        conflicts of interest, equality, compliance with rules and respectful
        communication. By doing so, we contribute to building a democratic
        society.
      </li>
      <li>
        We actively discourage non-objective differences in salary, compensation
        and career opportunities between women and men. This helps contribute to
        increased equality in society.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our CEO speaks about many important issues relating to e-commerce and
        takes part in the public debate on online shopping. By doing so, we
        contribute to an open conversation about problems concerning e-commerce,
        and how e-commerce can become safer and better.
      </li>
