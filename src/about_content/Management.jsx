      <h3>What are your favourite gadgets?</h3>
      <p>
        I am and have always been a sucker for gadgets. Lately I've been most
        invested in gadgets for a smart and automated home, you can always put
        up another <span> smart home sensor</span> and replace a dumb lightbulb
        with a <span>Philips Hue</span>. I also have an interest in garden tools
        and kitchen peripherals that you can't live without, like a properly
        good garlic press from
        <span>Rösle</span> or the phenomenal{" "}
        <span>vacuum cleaner Dyson V10.</span>

        Price comparison has always been a part of my life – so my hobby became

        proud to work with a business that's making a difference. We are a

        My family has just moved house, so we are spending a lot of time on
        finding exciting things for our home. Our latest purchase was two lamps
        and a great table from the Danish design brand HAY. My favourite gadget
        is without doubt my wireless Sonos Play 1 speaker, and for my home it's
        a pressure washer.

      <h3>Why did you choose to work at PriceCompare?</h3>
      <p>
        For one thing because we are building an amazing product with great
        value to our users. Also, it's a privelege to work with modern engineers
        and with incredibly ambitiös and nice colleagues. That we since 2022 are
        integrating with our new owners Klarna gives us an amazing opportunity
        to launch the product in even more markets globally.

        I like stuff that lasts, <span>this plunge cut saw</span> is one of my
        favourite tools at home and it's at least as popular with my friends and
        acquaintances. When we're having a game night, the{" "}
        <span>Nintendo Switch</span> comes out, and I prefer to play{" "}
        <span>Mario Kar</span>t or <span>Overcooked</span>. I recently bought a
        <span>smart thermostat</span> that optimizes my energy use, as well as
        makes it incredibly easy to adjust the temperature at home. Besides
        that, one of my most used products is the wireless and waterproof
        speaker <span>Wonderboom</span>, which has surprisingly good sound for
        its size.

      <h3>What’s your background?</h3>
      <p>
        Born in 1979. Degree in systems sciences from Luleå University of
        Technology and have been working with web development since 2005. Worked

      <h3>Why did you choose to work at PriceCompare?</h3>
      <p>
        After working as a consultant for many years, I wanted to move towards
        product development and feel true ownership of what I was working on.
        Working as a consultant was extremely educational, fun and varying, but
        it was that sense of ownership that I missed. PriceCompare itself as an
        easy choice. A well-known product, but poorly managed, with old
        technology and the obvious "second choice" after our competitors. With
        the new owners and a brand new IT department, it was a clear match for
        me. A product that I can build from scratch, all while building my own
        team. I could not ask for more!
      </p>
      <h3>What are your favourite gadgets?</h3>
      <p>
        Always my mobile phones. I am somewhat of a{" "}
        <span>Samsung enthusiast</span>, so I always get their latest flagship
        phone. Apart from that, it's probably
        <span>training equipment</span>. I have a lot of fun fitness stuff in my
        home gym.
