        <h2>Searching for your product</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re on PriceRunner to find a specific product the simplest thing
          to do is to use the search feature which you will find which you will
          find at the top of our start page. There you can search for
          categories, products and specific models, to easily find what you are
          looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you enter something into the search bar you will be shown a list
          of suggestions related to the words you just entered. The suggestion
          can be great in helping to narrow down your search and more easily
          find what you are looking for.

        <p>
          If you, for example, are on the look out for a mobile phone and enter
          this in the search bar, you will get a list of different manufacturers
          related to mobile phones. Two tests of different mobile phones also
          pops up, on these test you can read more about the products and find
          the right fit for you. You will also be able to see selected products
          related to your search. You can then either choose to click any of the
          shown options or also simply select “Search”, in this case you will be
          shown all relevant search options on an entire page instead of a drop
          down menu.

        <h2>Filtering & sorting</h2>
        <p>
          It should be simple to find a product with the qualities that you
          want, no matter if the product in question is a coffee maker, a bed, a
          jacket or a mobile phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why we have made it possible to filter and sort products within
          the same category based on the qualities that you are looking for. You
          can filter everything from brand to size, you can set a maximum cost,
          or filter on a more detailed level, like colour or material. This
          ensures that you only see the products that are relevant for you and
          thereby makes it even easier for you to find the perfect product.
          Simple enough right?

          products” you can easily compare the specifications of different
          products in a side by side grid format and get a clear overview of the
          pros and cons of the different products and help find your perfect
          fit.

          If you want a clear overview of all the products in a category then
          the “show as table” function is perfect for you. It puts all products
          in a table format which makes it possible to very simply compare
          several products with one another.

          You could for example choose to be shown the cheapest models first, or

      <div className="version">
        <h2>Compare product versions</h2>
        <p>
          There are many products that come in many different versions, and it
          can be useful to see the price difference between the different
          versions. For example, a phone that comes in different colours could
          have different prices, or the price difference between a phone with
          64GB and 128GB might be less than you think.
