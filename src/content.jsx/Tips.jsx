        <h1>6 tips: Make your online shopping climate-friendly</h1>
        <p>
          In order to make online shopping more climate-friendly and sustainable
          it is important for consumers to keep making demands on online
          retailers. The easiest and most efficient way to affect your
          environmental impact is to simply adapt your own consumer behaviour.
          Below are PriceRunner’s six simple tips on how to shop
          climate-friendly online.
        </p>
        <li>Only buy what you need</li>
        <p>
          The best way to reduce your negative impact on the environment is to
          not buy something unless you really need it. Take your time and think
          over if you really need the latest phone or a new trendy dress and try
          not to be tempted by different store’s various campaigns and
          promotions.
        </p>
        <li>Buy things that will last</li>
        <p>
          Buying good quality items will usually cost a bit more. But on the
          other hand you will get a product that will last longer which is good
          for the environment. On price comparison websites like PriceRunner you
          can read user reviews and scores on different products. You can also
          compare prices, it doesn’t have to cost a fortune to buy high quality
          products.
        </p>
        <li>Buy climate-friendly products</li>
        <p>
          Compare how good certain products are for the environment. Many
          products, for example white goods will have a standard for
          climate-friendly consumption. But you can also compare the impact on
          the environment with many different products, for we example clothes –
          these days you can easily find out if they are free from poisonous
          substances or made from recycled material.
        </p>
        <li>Shop local</li>
        <p>
          Avoid buying from online stores that are very far away, for example
          from China or the USA. Long shipping distances will naturally have a
          negative impact on the environment. Try to instead find local
          businesses in the UK the carry the product you are looking for.
        </p>
        <li>Shop from retailers that think about the environment</li>
        <p>
          More and more retailers are actually thinking carefully about how to
          operate their business in a more climate-friendly and sustainable way.
          Keep an eye out for online retailer’s that do climate-compensated
          shipping, are actively reducing their energy consumption in their
          logistics centre, are using recyclable packaging material, and are
          making demands on their logistics partners to deliver their products
          in an efficient manner.
