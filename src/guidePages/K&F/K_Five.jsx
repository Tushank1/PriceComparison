            We're finally past those really tedious first two months of the
            year, and why not celebrate the coming of spring by getting out into
            nature? With the right gear, both you and your kids can greatly
            enjoy a full-day excursion. Here are some tips that will keep your
            children happy in the great outdoors.

          Cold symptoms and coughs can hang around for a very long time. When
          your kids have watched all their favourite series on repeat and the
          quarantine biscuits have all gone, they’ll soon start to climb the
          walls. That’s when it's time for a trip out to the nearest patch of
          woodland. A trip out lets children get the sun on their faces and
          gives them the opportunity to release a bit of pent up energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what can you find to do out there among the trees and grass? Here
          are our tips for books and other things that make a trip just around
          the corner into a real adventure.

        <h2>Stay up to date</h2>
        <p>Read the government's guidance on accessing green spaces safely.</p>
        <h3>#GetOutsideAtHome</h3>
        <p>
          Even if there’s no green space near you, you can still get outside at
          home. The guys at Get Out With The Kids have teamed up with Coleman to
          create a HomeCampsite competition. Simply post a photo of your family
          camping at home, in the garden or even indoors, and tag it
          #HomeCampsite, to be in with the chance of winning a fabulous tent
          plus a year’s membership of the Camping and Caravanning Club (perfect
          for once campsites are open again!) You can find the rules
        </p>
        <h3>Bribes in the form of food</h3>
        <p>
          It's always easier to get the children to come along on a nature trip
          if they know there's something tasty in your backpack. It needn’t be a
          high-class culinary experience, either – hot dog sausages in a thermos
          and a packet of biscuits usually do the trick. Everything tastes
          better when you're sitting on a fallen tree in the countryside than it
          does at the kitchen table when you're all tired of each other’s
          company.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can put hot dog sausages in a normal thermos, but to have room for
          sausages for the entire family a food thermos is a good idea. You put
          the cold sausages into the thermos and pour over hot water. When it's
          time for lunch, the sausages are warmed up and ready to eat. Don’t
          forget to take a small bottle of ketchup and a bag of rolls.

              <span>A thermos for food</span>
              <p>
                Warm up your food at home and take it with you in a food
                thermos. Being able to eat warm food out in nature without the
                use of a kerosene stove is awesome.

        <h3>Let the kids play at being sherpas</h3>
        <p>
          Children usually think it's fun to carry their own bag. So pack the
          backpacks you bought for the new school year and which have just been
          left lying in the hall. The child can carry their own water bottle (a
          great way to prevent arguments about who drank most water and whose
          turn it is to drink next). It’s also a great place to put the gloves
          that often get lost when it's time to pick up pinecones, stones or
          fantastic sticks. And of course anything the kids find that they want
          to take home... they carry themselves.
        </p>
        <h3>Play nature bingo</h3>
        <p>
          Why not make the trip into a competition? Play nature bingo. Either
          draw up your own bingo cards together before you go out, or print out
          <span>ready-made bingo cards</span> from Wildlife Watch, the junior
          branch of The Wildlife Trusts. Play separately, or divide yourself
          into teams. Perhaps the children can challenge the adults? Or you can
          make up teams of a mixture of adults and children. Looking for
          specific things on your walk means you’ll keep your eyes open in an
          entirely new way.
        </p>
        <h3>Collect rubbish</h3>
        <p>
          Nobody is as bothered by rubbish in the countryside as children are.
          Take a rubbish bag for each of you and see who can fill theirs up
          first. While it's rather depressing to see how much plastic waste
          there is everywhere, the entire family will feel like environmental
          warriors when you come home with the rubbish and recycle it all
          correctly.
        </p>
        <h3>Don't forget!</h3>
        <p>
          The most important thing to think about before going out into nature
          with your children is that you don't need to do much to make it fun.
          You don't need to get in the car or go to a <span>national park</span>{" "}
          – you just need a tiny patch of woodland near your home. Would you
          like inspiration for future trips? Take a look at the{" "}
          <span> RSPB's site </span> to see if there are nature reserves in your
          local area.
