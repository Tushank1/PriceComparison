            Dressing for maternity doesn’t have to mean wearing clothes that
            look like sacks. On the contrary it’s easy to be really fashionable
            throughout your pregnancy, if you want. We have gathered maternity
            clothes for all different body types and styles, everything from
            plus size maternity clothes to maternity clothes on sale.

          During pregnancy, your body will obviously change shape in many ways,
          and it isn’t just your stomach that grows either. At first, you can
          get away with the usual stretchy knitwear from your normal wardrobe,
          but as time passes it’s nice to have at least some clothes that still
          feel like dressing up.

          Below are some cool clothes for pregnant women, and many of them even
          continue to work even after the birth.

            <h2>Speedo Essential U Back Maternity Swimsuit</h2>
            <p>
              Swimming during pregnancy is a gentle form of exercise that also
              gives the opportunity to feel weightless for a while. Having a
              swimsuit that provides support where you need it and also stays in
              place gives you an extra comfortable feeling in the swimming pool
              or on the beach.
            </p>
            <p>
              This maternity swimsuit from Speedo has folds on the sides and
              extra support for the bust.

        <h3>3 tips for buying maternity clothes</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Buy for the right season. If you get pregnant in January, by the
            time you need maternity clothes, it’s going to be the warmer months
            of summer. So be sure to buy clothes with that thought in mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            Buy clothes you like. This may sound like a pretty obvious tip, but
            it’s often easy to forget about that when you’re pregnant and just
            focus on buying something suited to maternity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Buy for the future. Many maternity clothes look great even after
            childbirth. So shop for brands that know it makes sense to design
            garments people like and will use for more than just a few months.
