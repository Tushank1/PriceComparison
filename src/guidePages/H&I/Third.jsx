          Do you want to get rid of that pile of clothes that always end up on a
          chair in the bedroom? Or are you just looking for a nice hook to hang
          your new kitchen towel on? With the right design, one – or more –
          hooks can add a lot more to a room than just the purely practical.
        </p>
        <p>
          A strip of knobs in the kid’s rooms makes it easy to organise costumes
          and with extra hanging options in the bathroom, it will be easy to
          live by the motto “everything in its place”. Here are seven stylish
          coat hooks to choose from.

            <p>
              Sometimes all you want is a plain and simple hook. Somewhere in
              every home there’s a space where it would be nice to hang up a
              jacket, a bag or the dog’s lead, but there isn’t the space for a
              row of hooks or a larger hanger.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s when this neat and stylish single hook from Rösle fits
              perfectly. Only 4 cm high and 2 cm wide, it’s ideal for most
              smaller spaces.

        <h3>3 tips for buying hooks and coat hangers</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Check your walls. Don’t fix up a hanger on a wall that isn't secure.
            No one wants to have plaster come down with their coat. Adjust the
            hook and fixing device to suit your wall.
          </li>
          <li>
            How much are you going to hang up? Are you really going to buy only
            three hooks when there are six of you in the house?
          </li>
          <li>
            Think outside the box. It’s easy to think that hooks are mostly used
            in halls and bathrooms, but many of them these days are design works
            of art and may warrant a more prominent position.
          </li>
