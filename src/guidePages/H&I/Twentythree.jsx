        <h2>8 tips: How to maintain your study discipline</h2>
        <span className="heading_span">1. Fixed times</span>
        <p>
          Make sure you set up a schedule and stick to it. Example schedule:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start at 9 o’clock every morning.</li>
          <li>Take a short break and stretch your legs once an hour.</li>
          <li>Eat lunch at 12 o’clock.</li>
          <li>Return to your studies at 1 o’clock.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your school requires you to be present during certain times, you
          should of course stick to these.
        </p>
        <span className="heading_span">2. Decide what you're going to do</span>
        <p>
          Make sure you have an objective every day. Decide on three tasks
          you're going to do during the day and work consciously towards these.
          You can count anything you manage to achieve in addition to this as a
          bonus. You can use digital services to make it really clear what you
          need to do for each one. For example, tools like: Trello and Asana.
        </p>
        <span className="heading_span">3. Set up a workplace</span>
        <p>
          Make sure you have a space at home that you dedicate to your studies.
          A space where you keep your computer, headset, books and important
          papers. And above all, make sure you have an ergonomic working
          position. If you have a desk in a separate room, this is perfect.
        </p>
        <span className="heading_span">4. Peace and quiet</span>
        <p>
          Makes sure that your parents and siblings know this is your quiet
          study place and that you don't want to be disturbed.
        </p>
        <span className="heading_span">5. Stick to your morning routines</span>
        <p>
          Don't just lie in bed in the morning. Get up, get dressed and have
          your breakfast just like you normally would. You’ll feel better and
          healthier if you stick to your routines.
        </p>
        <span className="heading_span">6. Communicate</span>
        <p>
          Keep in contact with your classmates so your social life doesn't come
          to a grinding halt. It’s easy to start feeling isolated if you're
          working remotely for a long period. By communicating via video link,
          so that you can actually see your classmates, you can top up your
          social interactions. For example, you can help each other to study,
          produce work in a group or just hang out during your coffee breaks.
          Examples of tools: Facetime, Zoom, Teams and Skype.
        </p>
        <span className="heading_span">7. Fresh air</span>
        <p>
          Simply sitting with your nose in your books for several hours makes
          you tired and absent-minded, and you’ll find it’s hard to focus and
          take in what you're reading. So go into the garden and blow the
          cobwebs away, or open your window so you get a little fresh air. If
          you can, combine this with moving your body too.
        </p>
        <span className="heading_span">8. Don’t forget to eat!</span>
        <p>
          Make sure you eat breakfast and have a proper lunch every day. And
          don’t forget the essential coffee or tea break in the afternoon. By
          topping up your body with fuel, you avoid unnecessary energy dips.
          There are also a number of study techniques that can help if you find
          it hard to achieve self-discipline, for example the Pomodoro
          technique, which includes a lot of what you’ve just read in this
          guide.

            <h2>Test-winning headphones with noise cancellation</h2>
            <p>
              If you want to study undisturbed, you may want to invest in some
              noise cancelling headphones. When the noise reduction is
              activated, the headphones (if they are good ones) should be able
              to effectively block out outside noise. This pair of headphones
              can handle this well with a sense of style, along with amazing
              audio quality, wireless control on the cover and great microphone
              sound quality.

            <p>
              Remote studying can mean lots of video meetings, for which you'll
              need a good webcam. Many laptops have built-in webcams, but if you
              currently lack one, this Logitech model is a fantastic
              alternative.
