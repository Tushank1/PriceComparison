          Candles raise the mood in an instant, and with the right candlestick
          they look even better. Nowadays, there are lots candles available that
          are powered by a battery, but still have that visual feeling of a real
          flame, so if you use a lot of candles in a season, why not replace
          some of them with battery candles? It also significantly reduces the
          risk of fire.

        <p>
          Here are seven beautiful candlesticks in different shapes and
          materials – choose your favourite and set the mood! Just don’t forget
          to put them out when you're done.

              pattern so typical of many of Iittala's glass products is
              reminiscent of ice in deepest winter. The Festivo series was
              designed by Timo Sarpaneva in 1966 and is often called a timeless
              Finnish classic.

              Pluto is a mouth-blown candlestick from Orrefors, designed by Lena
              Bergström. The candle is placed in a small metal collar, and the
              hollow glass dome almost gives the feeling that the light is
              floating. If you want to combine Pluto with similar products,
              there is a vase in a larger size in the same series that sits very
              nicely next to it.

              never wrong, and it’s also a material that’s very easy to blend in

              by Giovanna Hilke and is a tall candlestick with an exclusive
              feel, and attractive details that really stand out. Tuti is
              available in two heights: 30 and 40 cm, respectively, and can be
              combined attractively with other candlesticks in the Hilke

        <h3>3 tips for buying candlesticks</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mix and match. Everything doesn’t have to match in terms of details,
            because the candles themselves do a good job of forming a unit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust to size. Buy candles that are wide enough at the bottom to
            stand securely in the candlesticks
          </li>
          <li>
            Think about safety. Never leave burning candles unattended, and
            never place candles too close to curtains or other things that can
            easily catch fire.
