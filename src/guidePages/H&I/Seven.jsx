          Whatever the reason for a party or get-together, it’s always worth
          setting the table to look good. And if you don’t want to risk broken
          glass, but don’t find cardboard mugs very festive then why not choose
          plastic?
        </p>
        <p>
          Stylish plastic glasses are a good compromise – a proper festive feel
          with minimal risk of breakages.

              The Danish-Swiss company Bodum has been manufacturing kitchen

              are part of their production of plastic glasses they still feel
              pretty original in terms of style. These margarita glasses are
              made of durable polycarbonate and can be frozen as well as washed
              in the dishwasher. In addition, they can also be recycled.

        <h3>3 tips for buying plastic glasses</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Aim for good quality. Not all plastics are the same. Choose plastic
            glasses that won’t scratch easily or become dull or get worn out in
            the dishwasher.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go for style. Even if everyone knows they aren’t real glass, stylish
            plastic still looks great.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose a better plastic. Again, not all plastics are the same.
            Choose a plastic free from harmful substances.
          </li>
