            Few rooms benefit as much from order and tidiness as a bathroom.
            Often the space is limited and it can be a challenge to make sure
            everyone in the household has a place for their things. Here are
            some great hooks to help you find the best bathroom robe hook, and
            the trendiest ones whether you prefer a chrome bathroom hook or a
            bit more elaborate one.

          In addition to towels and bathrobes, there are many uses for hooks in
          the bathroom. Maybe the children’s swimwear needs a place to dry while
          waiting for the next swimming lesson, and you need to hang up a tube
          of cotton wool pads next to the mirror? And another space would be
          good for guest towels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you’re looking for a single hook or several hangers in a row,
          there are many stylish models to choose from. Just remember to double
          check for wires and pipes before you start drilling into any walls.

              The easiest way to freshen up your bathroom is to add something
              that requires minimal effort, and that's exactly what we have
              here. A stylish hanger with four hooks with a self-adhesive
              mounting. Just stick the holder on the wall and hang up your
              bathrobe and you’re done! There are many variants in the same
              series to choose from, if you want to supplement one hanger with
              more sizes.

              Anyone who loves curves should take a look at these hooks from
              Ferm Living. Curvature is a matt brass hook that is sold in a
              three-pack, and it works just as well in rooms other than
              bathrooms. The hooks are just over 6 cm high and 2.5 cm deep. Some
              minor deviations may occur as they are made by hand, which makes
              them all unique.

        <h3>Three tips when buying hooks for the bathroom</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Do you want to drill into the walls? Installation in a bathroom
            requires a little more patience and effort depending on how the room
            has been designed. Choose a self-adhesive hook if you want to avoid
            the work of familiarising yourself with all the pipes and so forth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do you have free height? With a vertical hanger, you can get more
            textile into less space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not certain where to put the hooks? If you use hooks with a suction
            plug, you can move them again and again and again without any
            problems.
          </li>
