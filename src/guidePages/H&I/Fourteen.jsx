            Whether you want to light candles or a fire in the woods, or just
            want even functional items in your home to look good, there’s a
            lighter for you.

          Most of us have probably run around the house rummaging in drawers for
          a lighter after the last match has been used up. With an attractive
          lighter, you don’t need to hide it and so will always be ready to
          light everything from the candles on a birthday cake to grandpa's
          cigar. Just remember to find a place where no children can see it.

          Lighters are powered by everything from gas and petrol to electricity
          – here are seven different models to help you keep the flames alive!

            <p>
              With their slogan "Designed for living", Dutch company Brabantia
              manufacture high-quality products that make everyday life easier
              for their customers. Their gas lighter, Brabantia Classic, is one
              such product that is durable, stylish and functional. With its
              neat design, it works well with all styles, and the longer handle
              with a button that is pushed upwards makes it easy to get a good
              grip on. Because this lighter is both narrow and oblong, it is
              perfect for lighting tealights in holders or for lighting the
              paper in a stove without burning yourself.

            <p>
              As you can tell from the name, this lighter is designed to have a
              good reach. If you’re going to start a gas stove or light paper
              under firewood, then this is the perfect model. The ergonomic
              handle makes it easy to hold even for those who may have reduced
              mobility in their fingers. The same applies to the large button,
              which is easy to both push in and hold until the fire lights.

            <p>
              Those who like the classic Zippo models may like this lighter
              twice as much, because it has two flames. It’s lit with a button,
              and not with the usual wheel, and the gas produces two powerful
              blue flames that easily ignite whatever it is that you need to
              light. The lighter is powered by butane gas and fits in all
              original cases for Zippo’s standard size lighters.

            <h2>Zippo 1610 Slim High Polished Chrome</h2>
            <p>
              A slightly slimmer and taller model of the otherwise chubby Zippo
              lighter. This model comes in a silvery design of polished chrome
              and has a storm-proof ignition. When you buy a Zippo, you always
              get a lifetime guarantee and you only need top it up with fuel
              when it actually runs out. The wicks are also replaceable when
              they have burned out. This means you can have one of these
              lighters for the rest of your life if you take care of it
              properly.

        <h3>Three tips when buying lighters</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Choose one in the right size. Choose one of the longer lighters if
            you want a good ergonomic grip and a button that’s easy to press.
          </li>
          <li>
            Are you going to light fires outdoors? If you only use a lighter to
            light candles, you don’t have to think about things like storm-proof
            flames. But if you're going to light fires outdoors, you may need
            that capability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check child safety. Fire is very exciting and perhaps even more
            exciting with buttons. Make sure you choose a child-safe lighter if
            you have kids, and always place it where the children can’t see it
            or reach it.
