            Doormats are a welcoming detail at your front door and also
            something to dry off your shoes on a rainy day. A doormat is both a
            practical and stylish part of your interior decor. We have gathered
            some fun and trendy options from some popular brands like the Coir
            doormat.

          On wet and muddy days, it’s nice to be able to brush off your shoes a
          little before coming into your home, and the best way to do that is
          with a rug outside the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doormats are available in many different models and designs. Common to
          all of them is that they can withstand wear and tear and are easy to
          brush or shake off when they have become a little too grubby. They
          also create a pleasant atmosphere outside your front door. Here are
          seven popular models.

            <p>
              This doormat from Danish company Hay is woven in durable jute and
              available in several different colour combinations. The mat feels
              strong and robust, and works just as well as a doormat in the hall
              as inside a patio door.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to jute, the doormat consists of dirt-repellent wool,
              which makes it both durable and easy to clean. A non-slip mat is
              recommended underneath as it has no rubberised bottom.

        <h3>3 tips for buying doormats</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Think about your weather. A doormat where you get lots of rain or
            snow should probably be made from a different material to a doormat
            for a cottage by the sea or a balcony door. Choose a heavy rug if
            you live somewhere windy!
          </li>
          <li>
            Maybe buy two. Maybe you actually need two mats: a sturdy one
            outside the door and another one inside for when you take off your
            boots.
          </li>
          <li>
            Measure your door. Most doormats come in standard sizes, but
            double-check the width of your door anyway, to make sure the mat is
            neither too wide nor too narrow.
          </li>
        </ol>
